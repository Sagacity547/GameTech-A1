User Manual

Overview: 
Move the player (the capsule) towards the end of the map using WASD. You can jump to traverse from platform to platform. 
If the gap is too wide, try out your jetpack! by holding Shift + Space, but be careful, run out of gas and you'll fall
out of the sky!

Networking: 
Play Single Player or with a friend. Game now includes Co-op play. It uses player hosting so the host will enter 
his/her/their IP address to start the server and the second player can join using that.

	the platforms.

Overall Design of the AI:

Behaviors Tree; AI will update itself mostly based on interaction with the Player through signals or is just autonomous walking through the game area.
Event driven AI. It will not react to any other agents within the area. The Behavior Tree will take 65% of our work effort, multiple agents will take about 15%
and Navigation will take about 20%. We assume with our plan we will not need to scale back, however we will pull back on characteristics/branches on the behavior tree.

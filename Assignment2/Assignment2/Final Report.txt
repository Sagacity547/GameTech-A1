Final Report:

Gavin: I found the implemntation of movement and gravity was a lot simpler than I thought it would be, once I read enough
documentation and was aware of the tools at my disposal, it became pretty simple. Implementing variable dependent movement was
tougher than I thought it was going to be, and in my opinion I think I could have done a better job on the ledge mechanic. 
My lack of knowledge of ray casting in godot led to me using areas instead of rays when in heignseight I should have just ray
casted. 

Julian: The signaling in Godot was the hardest part for me, it led to some weird method chaining in the player controller at 
first and overall gave me and the team headaches. I do think I did quite well on the level design, it offers multiple paths 
for the player to choose from and they all range in difficulty.

Evan: Getting the camera controller to work was hard because you needed to combine methods that didn't work well together. I
think it came a long way from where it started and I am much happier with the product. The sweeping change came from messing 
with different parameters to adjust camera sensetivity and range.

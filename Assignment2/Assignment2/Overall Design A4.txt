System: 

Behavior Tree System; AI will have a few different behaviors based on characteristics (personality types)
(eg. Based on body build, mood, personality). 

Specific behaviors will be found by going through binary tree (through)
implemented behavior tree). 

Print statements and testing through AI scenes will be used to debug AI behaviors.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Move the player (the capsule) towards the end of the map using WASD. You can attack NPC's using the left mouse button. NPC's that turn yellow will cowar in fear
and run away from the player while AI's that turn red after you hit them will attack the player dealing damage over time. The player doesn't really have a goal
in this game outside of defeat all the NPC's if they wish to or avoiding getting beat up by the NPC's
